# Restaurant POS System - Redesign Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive redesign of the Restaurant POS system. The goal was to transform the existing application into a modern, premium, and visually appealing platform that offers an exceptional user experience. The new design focuses on a warm and inviting aesthetic, intuitive interactions, and a high degree of polish.

## Implemented Features & Design System

The following section details the full scope of the application redesign, from the foundational style architecture to the individual component overhauls.

### 1. Foundation: Global Styles & Design System

A comprehensive design system was established to ensure consistency and a premium feel across the entire application.

- **Typography:**
    - Imported 'Playfair Display' for display headings and 'Poppins' for body text and UI elements from Google Fonts to create a sophisticated and readable typographic hierarchy.
- **CSS Custom Properties (Design Tokens):**
    - A full suite of CSS variables was created in `src/styles.css` to define the application's visual language. This includes:
        - **Colors:** A warm and inviting palette (`--brand-primary`, `--brand-secondary`, `--text-primary`, `--background-main`, `--error`, etc.).
        - **Spacing:** A consistent scale for margins, padding, and gaps (`--space-xs` to `--space-xl`).
        - **Typography:** Font families, sizes, and weights.
        - **Borders & Shadows:** Radii (`--rounded-md`, `--rounded-lg`) and elevation (`--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`) for depth and tactility.
        - **Transitions:** Standardized animation timings for interactive elements.
- **Global Styles:**
    - A modern CSS reset was applied for cross-browser consistency.
    - Base styles for the body, headings, and other core elements were defined to use the new design tokens.

### 2. Core Application Layout (`layout.component.ts`)

The main application shell was redesigned to be modern, clean, and intuitive.

- **Header:** A fixed header with a subtle background color, containing the restaurant's name and a user profile avatar.
- **Sidebar:** A vertical navigation bar with redesigned icons, clear labels, and a distinct active-link style to provide clear feedback to the user.
- **Content Area:** The main content area has a contrasting background color to separate it from the navigation elements, creating a focused workspace.

### 3. Page-by-Page Redesign

Each page of the application was systematically overhauled to align with the new design system.

- **Dashboard (`dashboard.component.ts`):**
    - **Layout:** Transformed into a modern, multi-column dashboard using a card-based system.
    - **Stat Cards:** Key metrics ("Total Revenue", "Total Orders", "Total Customers") are displayed in visually distinct cards.
    - **Data Tables:** "Recent Orders" and "Top Selling Products" are presented in clean, well-styled tables and lists within their own cards, making data easy to digest.

- **Orders (`orders.component.ts`):**
    - **Layout:** Upgraded to a full-page card layout.
    - **Header:** Features a prominent title, a functional search bar, and status filter buttons (`All`, `Pending`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`).
    - **Data Table:** A completely restyled table with improved spacing, typography, and status badges for clarity.
    - **Interactivity:** Includes "View Details" and "Change Status" buttons on each row.

- **Products (`products.component.ts`):**
    - **Layout:** Converted to a full-page card layout.
    - **Header:** Contains a title, search bar, and category filter buttons (`All`, `Food`, `Drinks`).
    - **Data Table:** Redesigned table for product listings with clear pricing and an "Add to Cart" button for each item.

- **Customers (`customers.component.ts`):**
    - **Layout:** Modernized with a full-page card layout.
    - **Header:** Includes a title and a search bar for easy filtering.
    - **Data Table:** A redesigned table displays customer information.
    - **Actions:** "Edit" and "Delete" buttons are provided for each customer record.

- **Billing (`billing.component.ts`):**
    - **Layout:** Overhauled into a two-column Point-of-Sale (POS) interface, with a product grid on the left and a cart summary on the right.
    - **Product Selection:** Products are displayed as clickable cards in a responsive grid.
    - **Cart Summary:** A detailed and interactive cart that includes:
        - An itemized list with quantity adjustment controls (+/- buttons).
        - A running total, calculated with a `computed` signal.
        - "Clear Cart" and "Checkout" actions.
        - An "empty cart" state message.

- **Settings (`settings.component.ts`):**
    - **Layout:** Rebuilt into a clean, single-column form within a page card, centered for focus.
    - **Organization:** The form is divided into logical sections ("Restaurant Profile" and "Notification Settings") with clear headings.
    - **Form Styling:** All inputs, labels, and buttons are styled according to the design system.
    - **Interactive Elements:** A modern toggle switch was implemented for enabling/disabling email notifications.

### 4. Advanced Header & Navigation System
To improve user experience and navigation context, the header and routing system were significantly enhanced.

- **Dynamic Title Service (`title.service.ts`):**
    - A new singleton service was created to manage the page's title, subtitle, and breadcrumbs using Angular Signals. This allows any component to reactively update the header's content.

- **Route-Driven Content:**
    - The `app.routes.ts` file was updated to include a `data` object for each route, containing the `title`, `subtitle`, and `breadcrumb` path. This centralizes the header content and links it directly to the application's structure.

- **Dynamic Header Component (`header.component.ts`):**
    - The header was refactored to inject the `TitleService` and display the dynamic title, subtitle, and breadcrumbs. The hardcoded text was removed entirely.

- **Browser Title Updates (`layout.component.ts`):**
    - The main layout component now injects Angular's `Title` service. It listens to router events and automatically updates the browser tab's title on every successful navigation, improving SEO and user orientation (e.g., "Products | Restaurant POS").

- **Breadcrumbs UI:**
    - The header now renders a breadcrumb trail (e.g., "Home / Products"), providing users with a clear understanding of their location within the application.

- **Type Safety & Fallbacks:**
    - A `RouteData` interface was created to ensure all route definitions are strongly typed.
    - Fallback logic was implemented in the `layout.component.ts` to ensure the header always displays a sensible default title if route data is missing.
